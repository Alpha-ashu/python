📜 Sheet 1: "Consolidated" (Summary of All Records)
This sheet provides an overview of all processed records, including:

Record Name → The filename of the JSON pair (bulk and single response).
Coverage Percentage → Percentage of matched fields.
Matched Values → Number of matches vs total comparisons.
Record Name	Coverage Percentage	Matched Values
916845293_43754038	85.00%	17/20
948367410_83746512	92.50%	37/40
981091955_56473829	78.00%	23/30

✔️ This sheet gives a high-level summary of the validation results for all records.

📄 Sheet 2, 3, ... (Individual Record Comparisons)
Each record gets its own sheet, named after the bulk response file (trimmed to 30 characters for Excel compatibility).

Each row compares one key-value pair between bulk (legacy) and single (payer) JSON files.

🚀 Request Example
"I need a Python script that processes JSON files from bulkresponses and singleresponses, compares their values based on a mapping document, and generates an Excel report. The Excel file should have:

A consolidated summary sheet listing all records with their match percentage and matched values.
Separate sheets for each record, containing detailed field-by-field comparisons between bulkresponses and singleresponses."
"The comparison should be based on an Excel mapping file, and the match status should be categorized as: ✅ Matched, ⚠️ Partial Match, or ❌ Not Matched."

📝 Additional Enhancements
You can also specify additional enhancements such as: ✅ Color formatting → Green for Matched, Yellow for Partial Match, Red for Not Matched.
✅ Sorting or filtering options in the Excel report.
✅ Logging improvements to track missing files or errors.
